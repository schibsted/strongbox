**Strongbox is not actively maintained. Alternatives include [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) (which was launched after Strongbox was open sourced).**

Strongbox is a CLI/GUI and SDK to manage, store, and retrieve secrets (access tokens, encryption keys, private certificates, etc). Strongbox is a client-side convenience layer on top of AWS KMS, DynamoDB and IAM. It manages the AWS resources for you and configure them in a secure way.
