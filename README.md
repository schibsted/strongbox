**March 2019: Strongbox is in low maintenance mode; it will continue to receive minor updates, but we recommended new users to check out [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) (which was launched after Strongbox was open sourced), as well as [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).**

Strongbox is a CLI/GUI and SDK to manage, store, and retrieve secrets (access tokens, encryption keys, private certificates, etc). Strongbox is a client-side convenience layer on top of AWS KMS, DynamoDB and IAM. It manages the AWS resources for you and configure them in a secure way.

Strongbox has been used in production since mid-2016 and is now used extensively within Schibsted.
